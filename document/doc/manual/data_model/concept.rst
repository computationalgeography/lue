The LUE data model organizes all information related to one
or multiple collections of objects in a unified manner, in a single
dataset. All information represented using the data model is organized
in a hierarchical fashion. After the next overview, the elements of the
data model are described in more detail.

At the top of the LUE data model the :ref:`phenomena <concept_phenomenon>`
are located. These are collections of objects of the same kind. Objects
can represent abstract things, like economies, or very concrete things,
like birds. Whatever makes sense in a certain context. Within a phenomenon
all information related to the objects is
aggregated into :ref:`property-sets <concept_property_set>`.
Property-sets aggregate information about objects that share the same
:ref:`time domain <concept_time_domain>` and :ref:`space domain
<concept_space_domain>`. In the time domain, information is stored about
*when* something was or is, whereas in the space domain, information
is store about *where* something was or is. Often, information about
when and where something is differs, depending on the kind of
information. For example, the sex of animals does not change through
time and space, but the weight does. In the data model, such information
is stored in different :ref:`properties <concept_property>`, and
properties sharing a time and space domain are aggregated into
property-sets.
