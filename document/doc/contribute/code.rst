Theme
~~~~~
The LUE documentation is generated using Sphinx. The configuration is
stored in `document/doc/conf.py.in`_.

The theme we use is an updated version of the `Read the Docs Sphinx
Theme`_. We forked that project and based our theme on release 0.5.0.
When LUE is configured and the documentation target is requested, the
CMake script will checkout our fork containing the LUE Sphinx Theme in
the build directory. The Sphinx configuration file will pick up the theme.

If you want to update the LUE Sphinx Theme, then this is more or less
the procedure:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Initialize a Conda environment specifically for changing the theme
   cd lue
   conda env create -f environment/configuration/conda_rtd_environment.yml
   conda activate lue_rtd

   # Checkout the theme's sources from its branch
   cd ..
   git clone git@github.com:computationalgeography/sphinx_rtd_theme.git
   cd sphinx_rtd_theme
   git checkout lue_theme

   # Install software required for testing and generating the theme
   # See https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html
   pip install -e '.[dev]'
   npm install

   # Start an HTTP server that will pick-up changes to SASS files
   npm run dev

   # Change the theme's SASS files
   # ...

   # Generate the theme's CSS
   npm run build

   # Check in changes to SASS files and CSS files
   # ...

The colours used in the theme are taken from the `Nord theme`_. The goal
of the theme is to use less colours and hover effects than the original
one.

The LUE-specific overrides of the underlying theme are located
in ``src/sass/_lue_theme_*.sass``. These SASS files are included from
``src/sass/theme.sass``.

When committing, skip ``package-lock.json``. It doesn't seem to be necessary
to commit.

.. important::

    Don't forget to generate and commit the theme's CSS
    (``sphinx_rtd_theme/static/css/theme.css``). Otherwise, the changes
    to the theme will not be visible to users.

Updating LUE to pick up the updated Sphinx theme involves these steps:

#. Note the commit hash in the updated ``lue_theme`` branch
#. Update commit hash in ``environment/cmake/LueConfiguration.cmake``
   (search for ``LUE_SPHINX_LUE_THEME_REQUIRED``)
#. If you use a local repository cache, pull in updates in the
   ``LUE_REPOSITORY_CACHE/sphinx_rtd_theme`` directory
#. Remove current theme sources from build directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd $LUE_OBJECTS
      rm -r _deps/sphinx_lue_theme-*

#. Rebuild documentation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd $LUE_OBJECTS
      rm -r document/doc/sphinx/
      make sphinx_doc
