## Issues

### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with LUE software or documentation, and a related issue doesn't already exist, you can
open a new issue using a relevant [issue
form](https://github.com/computationalgeography/lue/issues/new/choose).


### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/computationalgeography/lue/issues) to find one that
interests you. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.


## Make changes

1. Fork the repository.
1. Setup the development environment
1. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

   We name branches according to the issue number, e.g.: gh5 for the branch on Github in which
   the issue with number 5 gets solved. You may want to do the same, but this is not a requirement.


## Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.


## Create a pull request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand
  your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to
  issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
  if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer
  edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)
  so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a LUE team member will review your
  proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as
  [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
