Install using Conda
===================
The LUE Conda package is a great way to get LUE installed quickly on your laptop or desktop
computer. For maximum portability, it is built using general sane settings. This version is
fine for demo's, testing models, and in education, for example. But,

.. warning::

   In case you want the best possible performance, you must build LUE yourself, from the sources
   and using settings that match your specific platform.

Building LUE yourself is also required if you want to perform distributed calculations, using
multiple cooroperating processes. For more information about building LUE, see
:ref:`install_source`.

Installing LUE using Conda is as easy as:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge lue

Information about Conda can be found in the `Conda documentation`_. If
you do not have the conda command available yet, then you can install
`Miniconda`_. Information about the LUE Conda package is available at the
`LUE Anaconda Cloud page`_.

.. _Conda documentation: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/
.. _Miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
.. _LUE Anaconda Cloud page: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lue

In case you just want to test things out, this is a workflow that will allow you to clean-up
once you are done (adjust versions / names when needed):

.. code-block:: bash

   # Keep Conda up to date
   conda update -n base -c defaults conda

   # Create new Conda environment
   conda create --name test_lue python=3.10
   conda activate test_lue

   # Install LUE
   conda install -c conda-forge lue

   # Test
   # ...

   # Clean-up
   conda deactivate
   conda env remove --name test_lue

For inspiration for testing LUE you can have a look at the `lue_tutorial`_ repository.
