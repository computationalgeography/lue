# Welcome to the LUE contributing guide  <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue,
creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.


### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with LUE software or documentation, and a related
issue doesn't already exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue
form](https://github.com/computationalgeography/lue/issues/new/choose).


#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/computationalgeography/docs/issues) to find
one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.


### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository.

2. Setup the development environment

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

   We name branches according to the issue number, e.g.: gh5 for the branch on Github in which
   the issue with number 5 got solved. You may want to do the same, but this is not a requirement.


### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.


### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps
  reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to
  issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
  if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer
  edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)
  so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a LUE team member will
  review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as
  [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
