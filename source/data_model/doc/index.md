# Data model

The data model code is divided into libraries that depend on each other. From lower to higher levels of
abstraction these are:

- `lue_hdf5`: C++ wrappers around the HDF5 C-library
- `lue_cxx`: Implementation and API of the data model code
- `lue_python`: Python API of the data model code

Besides the libraries the data model code contains the following command line utilities:

- `lue_translate`: For translating between LUE and other data formats
- `lue_validate`: For validating LUE datasets
- `lue_view`: For viewing the contents of LUE datasets
